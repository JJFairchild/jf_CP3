// Jonas Fairchild, Pokemon Battle

/*
Write a program that creates a Pokémon battle game using structures for Pokémon and enumeration for the menu in C++. The game should allow users to explore (find Pokémon), battle, heal Pokémon, and exit the game. Implement structures for Pokémon that include names, max HP, attacks, and level. Use enumeration for the main menu options.

The game must include the following features:
- A main menu with options to explore, battle, heal, and exit.
- Exploration feature to find and catch Pokémon.
- Battle system where users can fight against wild Pokémon or other trainers.
- Healing option to restore Pokémon HP.
- Multiple attack options for each Pokémon during battles.
- Different Pokémon types with associated weaknesses and strengths.
- Type-based damage bonuses during battles.

OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
    Pokémon Battle Game Menu:
    1: Explore
    2: Battle
    3: Heal Pokémon
    4: Exit
    Enter your choice (1-4): 1
    You found a wild Pikachu! Do you want to catch it? (Y/N): Y
    Pikachu has been added to your team!

KEY REMINDERS:
- Use structures to define Pokémon with properties like name, max HP, current HP, attacks, level, and type.
- Implement enumeration for the main menu options.
- Create multiple attack options for each Pokémon.
- Implement a type system with weaknesses and strengths (e.g., Water is strong against Fire).
- Use appropriate variable types and error handling.
- Ensure the game continues running until the user chooses to exit.
- Implement proper input validation and error handling.

BONUS (Rubber Duck Prize):
- To earn a rubber duck prize, include multiple attack options that users can select during battle, and implement a comprehensive type system with proper weaknesses and strengths that provide damage bonuses.

CLARIFICATIONS:
- You should have 5 different Pokemon types.
- Each type needs at least 1-2 Pokemon in it. 
- Pokemon should have at least 3 attacks to choose from.

HOW TO SUBMIT:
- Submit the link to your project on Github
