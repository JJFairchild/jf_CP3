Lesson 6: Pointers
LESSON I CAN: I CAN use pointers in C++

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Define pointers
- Use pointers in a program
- Describe the benefits of pointers

State Standards:
***This is a UVU CS1410 requirement***

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Write a program that asks the user to enter books, movies, shows, colors, comics, etc. until they can't think of anymore. 
- Start your array with only 5 spaces. Continue to increase the size of the array as your user hits the array cap. 
- THEN, print out each of the inputs they gave you!

KEY REMINDERS:
- Remember you have to set your variable types
- You have to get the standard library to create your inputs and outputs
- Make sure your arrows are pointing the right way for the input/output stream. 
- You have to set the length of the array when you create it

HOW TO SUBMIT:
- Submit the link to your project on Github
