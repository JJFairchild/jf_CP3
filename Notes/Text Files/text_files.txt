Lesson 1: Streams and Txt
LESSON I CAN: I CAN use read and write to TXT and CSV files

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Explain how streams work
- Read and write to a txt file
- Read and write to a csv file

State Standards: ***This is a UVU CS1410 requirement***

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- What are the 3 main sources of data for a program
The terminal, files, and networks.

- What are streams?
They are sources or destinations of data.

- What are the different streams we might need to include in a program? 
istream, ostream (iostream)

- What is the base class for all streams?
int

- What is buffer?
A temporary storage in memory for data being transferred.

- How do you clear the buffer?
Using cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max()).

- How do you handle invalid inputs from the terminal
Catch it with cin.fail() and then erase the invalid input with cin.clear(); and cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');.

- What streams are for files specifically
ifstream, ofstream, and fstream

- How do you write to a text file?
You need to #include <fstream> and run ofstream ofile, then do ofile.open(x) where x is the name of the file you want to run, then after checking whether the file is open you can manipulate the text file.

- What do stream manipulators let us do?
They let you change the way you write to files.

- How do you write to a CSV?
In the same way you write to a text file, but organized with commas.

- How do you read a text file?
You need to run ifstream ifile, then ifile.open(x) where x is the file name, then after checking if it's actually open you can read the text file with getline() and whatnot.

- How do you read a CSV file?
Same way you read from a text file, but you have to account for comma-separated lines.

- What is a delimiter?
A special character that is used to determine when your getline() stops.

- How do you read an entire CSV?
You loop through it using a while loop and getline() for each row.

- How do you turn items from a CSV into objects of a structure?
You need to get a line from the csv, break it into the correct pieces, then assign them to the objects of the structure.
