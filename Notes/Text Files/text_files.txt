Using cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max()).

- How do you handle invalid inputs from the terminal
Catch it with cin.fail() and then erase the invalid input with cin.clear(); and cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');.

- What streams are for files specifically
ifstream, ofstream, and fstream

- How do you write to a text file?


- What do stream manipulators let us do?
They let you change the way you write to files.
