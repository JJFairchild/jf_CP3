Lesson 1: Classes and Objects
LESSON I CAN: I CAN create objects using a class

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Create a class
- Describe how a class is an abstraction of an object
 -Create a constructor method
- Create a magic method
- Create methods to manipulate the class objects

State Standards:
    STRAND 5: Students will design and implement advanced object oriented concepts.

    STANDARD 1: Implement object-oriented programs

        - Create classes with minimal extraneous relationships (high cohesion and low coupling)

        - Demonstrate and use composition and aggregation (HAS-A) relationships

        - Demonstrate the use of class variables (static variables) 

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- What is a class?
A class is an abstraction of an object that you can customize and create methods for.

- What is an object?
An object is an instance of a class that has attributes.

- How is a class a form of encapsulation? 
It has attributes and methods that are all included in the class object.

- How is a class an abstraction of an object?
It defines the attributes and methods without specifying the exact details.

- How do you access information in an object?
You use dot notation: object.attribute

- How do you initialize a class?
Type "class ClassName:", then make sure you have an __init__ function that defines all the values the class needs.

- How do you set a default value 
You set an attribute to something in the parentheses of the __init__ function. The default values have to be the last values defined.

- How do you use type hinting?
Outside of the methods and before the __init__ function, type "attribute: type" to make sure that a given attribute is of a specific type.

- How do you set an attribute to be private?
Put an underline before the attribute name in all places it's used.

- How do you make a class method?
Define a function within the class, make sure to include self as a parameter.

- Why do we include docstrings
To give details to others who might read our code.

- What does "self" do as a parameter for class methods?
It tells the program that it's only looking at one object: itself.

- What are getter and setter methods?
A setter changes the value of an attribute, a getter displays/returns an attribute.

- What are magic methods?
They are methods surrounded in double underlines, and they change how the class object interacts with other things.

- Where are class objects saved? (heap or stack?)
Classes are saved on the heap.
