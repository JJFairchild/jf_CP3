Lesson 3: Strings, Arrays, Conditionals
LESSON I CAN:I CAN use strings arrays and conditionals in C++

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Describe the basics of how strings are made in C++
- Create an array
- Build a conditional to check an array

State Standards: ***This is a UVU CS1410 requirement***

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- What is Narrowing?
Narrowing is when you take a variable that already exists and turn it into a data type that takes up less space. You may lose information if there is not enough space in the smaller variable.

- What is a basic way to generate random numbers in C++?
You have to #include <cstdlib> and <ctime> and initialize a variable with time(nullptr), seed the rand() function with srand(seconds), then declare the variable with int x = rand() % y, where y is the upper limit of your random number plus one.

- What is an array?
An array is a list, but it cannot have mixed data types.

- How do I create an array?
Declare it like a variable, except afterwards you need to put the length of the list in brackets. ex: int grades[5] = {96, 75, 89, 90, 98};

- How do you make strings in C?
Make sure to use namespace std, but then you can declare it by calling the variable type a string: string name = "myname";

- How did C++ improve creating strings? 
It made a string variable type, whereas before you had to use the char type, which was harder to use in multiple ways.

- How do I search a string?
You can use .starts_with("x") and .ends_with("x"),which returns 1 or 0 depending if it starts or ends with x. You can also use .front() or .back(), which returns the first and last letter of the string respectively. You can also use .find() and .rfind(), .find_first_of(), and .find_last_of().

- How do I modify a string?
You can use .insert(), .append() to add things, .replace() to replace things, and .erase(), and .clear() to delete things.

- What are some string methods? 
.starts_with(), .ends_with(), .front(), .back(), .find(), .rfind(), .find_first_of(), .find_last_of(), .find_first_not_of(), .find_last_not_of(), .insert(), .append(), .replace(), .erase(), .clear(), .length(), .substr()
