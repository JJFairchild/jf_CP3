INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- What is Narrowing?
Narrowing is when you take a variable that already exists and turn it into a data type that takes up less space. You may lose information if there is not enough space in the smaller variable.

- What is a basic way to generate random numbers in C++?
You have to #include <cstdlib> and <ctime> and have int seconds = time(nullptr);
