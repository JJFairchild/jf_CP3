Lesson 5: Working with Strings
LESSON I CAN: I CAN change strings in C++

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Get substrings
- Use escape characters
- Check what the string is
- Convert the string to other data types
- Use a raw string

State Standards:
***This is a UVU CS1410 requirement***

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- How do I get a substring from within a string?
Create a substring with string.substr(starting index, ending index) and it will create a smaller string contained within the first.

- How do I create an escape character in C++
In a string, type a backslash. There are many different things that this can do depending on the following character.

- How do I convert a string to another data type?
Use std::sto_(string) where _ is the common character associated with the data type (i for int, f for float, etc.).

- What is a raw string and when would I use it?
A raw string is when a string has the prefix R (ex. R"stringhere"). It ignores escape characters and prints the code exactly as is.
