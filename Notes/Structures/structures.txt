Lesson 1: Structures
LESSON I CAN: I CAN build custom structures in C++

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Define structures
- Create structures
- Use pointers to access structures
- Add information to a structure
- Overload an operator

State Standards: ***This is a UVU CS1410 requirement***

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- What are structures?
A structure is a custom data type known as an ADT (abstract data type)

- How do you build a structure?
Initialize it like a variable using struct, although the variable name should be in PascalCase.

- What can be held in a structure?
You can make objects in a structure, and they are initialized like normal variables.

- How do you access the information in a structure?
Use the dot operator, for example: ClassName.variable

- How do you overload an operator
