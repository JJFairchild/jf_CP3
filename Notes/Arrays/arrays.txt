Lesson 4: Arrays
LESSON I CAN: I CAN use strings arrays and conditionals in C++

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Iterate over an array
- Compare items in arrays
- Pass an array into a function
- Understand type_t
- Unpack an array
- Search and sort arrays
- Create multi dimensional arrays

State Standards:
***This is a UVU CS1410 requirement***

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- How are for loops constructed in C++?
Use 'for (counting variable; continue condition; increment variable){code}

- When do you need to use curly brackets in C++?
After a conditional or loop that is more than one line long.

- How do you compare items in arrays?
Within a for loop, check if array1[i] == array2[i] with some modification to the index if needed (eg. i-3)

- How do you use an array as an argument in a function?
When defining the function, you must 

- What is type_t?
It's a variable type that 

- Why would we use type_t?


- How do you search an array?


- How do you sort an array?


- How do you make a multi-dimensional array?
