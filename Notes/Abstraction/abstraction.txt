Lesson 2: Abstraction
LESSON I CAN: I CAN create abstract classes

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Define Abstract classes
- Determine WHEN to use an abstract class
- Distinguish between abstract and concrete methods
- Create abstract classes

State Standards:
    STRAND 5: Students will design and implement advanced object oriented concepts.
        STANDARD 1: Implement object-oriented programs
            - Create classes with minimal extraneous relationships (high cohesion and low coupling)
            - Demonstrate and use composition and aggregation (HAS-A) relationships
            - Demonstrate the use of class variables (static variables) 

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Notes are taken during class and can be taken on paper, on a digital document, or in a specific folder in your programming files (VS Code and Github)

QUESTIONS:
- Why can't you create an object from an abstract class?
Because they are only meant to be a parent for children classes, not to be used for anything.

- How do abstract classes and abstract methods work together?
They enforce a specific layout for any child classes.

- What does abc stand for?
Abstract Class

- What are decorators? 
Decorators begin with an @ symbol and give further information about what follows.

- What is an abstract method?
An abstract method is a method that is meant to be overwritten in a child class.

- What is a concrete method?
They're methods you write normally, not with an abstractmethod decorator.

- What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class that's designed to be overwritten.

- How do you make an abstract method?
You have to write @abstractmethod before your method.

- How can you create a class that inherits from multiple parent classes?
In the parentheses when initializing a class, include both parent classes, separated by a comma.

- Why does the inheritance order matter?
If multiple methods have the same name, the one inheited first will be the one used when it's called.

- What does the mro() method do when you call it on a class?
It tells you which classes you inherit from first.

- What is Method resolution order?
It's the order which child classes inherit methods from parents.

TO SUBMIT:
    You have 3 different submission options for this assignment. You can:
